# Bilibili BV to av

[中文README](README_zh.md)

# Usage
Load Bilibili_BV_to_av.user.js in your browser with TamperMonkey addon. I've only tested Chrome 96, but it should work on any modern browser with TamperMoney.

The script uses regex to match and replace the BV id. This approach should be relatively future proof even if Bilibili changes its frontend logic.

2021, net2cn, sick of BV id.
